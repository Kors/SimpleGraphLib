# SimpleGraphLib

Support 2 types of graphs 
- directed
- undirected 

Support 3 operations:
- addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
- addEdge - adds edge to the graph
- getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesnâ€™t have to be optimal)

Vertices are of a user defined type.

Future extensions:
- Add weighted edges support
- Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph
- Make graphs thread safe
